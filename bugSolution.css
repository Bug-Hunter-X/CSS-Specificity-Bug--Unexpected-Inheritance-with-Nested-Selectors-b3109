The solution involves increasing the specificity of the rule targeting nested list items to ensure that it overrides the rule for all `li` elements. Here is the corrected CSS:

```css
#myList li {
  color: blue;
}

#myList li:first-child {
  color: red;
}

#myList > ul > li {
  color: green; /* Increased specificity by using child combinators */
}
```

By adding the `>` child combinator to the selector, we explicitly target only the immediate child `ul` elements within `#myList` and their direct children `li` elements, making the specificity higher and overriding previous rules.
